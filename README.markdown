Workout Timer
===========

What
-----
An android app for tracking your workout breaks

Why
----
You have to look at the time between sets and moves. It's distracting and hard to track.
There needs to be an easy way to track it.

How
---
Most of the people uses headphones during working. And generally phones are the music resource.

You can basically use your volume up/down keys(on your headset or on the phone itself) to start timers.
when it runs out, a little notification beeps. So you can understand when to finish break without interrupting
the music. 

There are two kind of breaks, short and long
Short breaks are for the rest between sets(volume up)
Long breaks are for the rest between moves(volume down)
